## Purpose

This project is a simple implementation of a chain system that tries to recreate the game 'Chained Together' in
Minecraft. \
It was made as a Trial Project for Cytooxien.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the project using `./gradlew build`
3. Copy the jar file from `build/libs` to your server's plugin folder
4. Start the server

## Usage

- Invite a player by right-clicking them. They will receive an invitation and can accept it by right-clicking you back.
- Once accepted, the invitor can choose a difficulty. The difficulty will determine the length of the chain.
- Players can pull their partner towards them by using the offhand key (default: F).
- You can disband the chain by sneaking and right-clicking your partner.
